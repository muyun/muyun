Hi, I'm Raymond, educating in engineering and business fields have taught me to be good at novel solutions to difficult problems. Thanks to the experience of working on a range of projects from telecommunication to web application to data science, I have learned to adapt to any challenge that comes my way. I can work well with challenges and uncertainty.  

If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at bestraymond@icloud.com. I’d be happy to hear from you. 
I am also available for project consulting, reach out if you'd like to chat.

Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-development, and experiencing some new.  

You can support my open work by tipping me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/muyun), or send me BTC at 19YGkJm3QTARcpatbdUdmYy8ZuDLZ91nr3  .
