Hi, I'm _muyun, a Computer Engineer & Scientist.

I like problem solving, and reading. I write at [blog.reader](https://muyun.github.io/).  

If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at wenlzhao@gmail.com. I’d be happy to hear from you. 
I am also available for project consulting. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_muyun).

Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-development, and experiencing some beauty,love, and local culture.  

You can support my open work by tipping me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/muyun), or send me BTC at 19YGkJm3QTARcpatbdUdmYy8ZuDLZ91nr3  .
