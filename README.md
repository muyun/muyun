Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong, a Computer Engineer & Scientist.

I like problem solving, and reading. I write articles at [blog.reader](https://muyun.github.io/).  
If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at wenlzhao@gmail.com. I’d be happy to hear from you. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_muyun).



Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like Nature, self-improvement, product & service, and art NOW.  
I worked as Technical Officer at HSUHK, RA at CityU and HKBU, Software Engineer at HKCREO (a Fintech startup) and Alcatel-Lucent S.A. (Nokia Corporation now).

I have a BS in Electroic and Information Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://www.sciencemag.org/collections/celebrating-125-years-academic-excellence-wuhan-university-1893-2018?fbclid=IwAR0RzFSkpxaI8wk61JDnE7p6SWr7SlKXLyoFHkrg4-iqKGiRyE2gZfaGl8s), and a MS in Computer Science from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).
