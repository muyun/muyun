Hi, I'm Raymond,Educating in an engineering and business field has taught me to always be curious and that every problem has a solution. Thanks to the experience of working on a range of projects from telecommunication to web application to data science, I have learned to adapt to any challenge that comes my way. My wide range of experience makes me good at engineering novel solutions to difficult problems. I never back down from a challenge and can work well with uncertainty.    

If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at wenlzhao@gmail.com. I’d be happy to hear from you. 
I am also available for project consulting, reach out if you'd like to chat.

Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-development, and experiencing some new.
