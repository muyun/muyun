Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong, a Computer Engineer & Scientist.

I like problem solving and reading.
If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at wenlzhao@gmail.com. I’d be happy to hear from you. You can also find me on Twitter or Github.

I am an active learner. Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like Nature, self-improvement, and product & service NOW. I worked as Technical Officer at HSUHK, RA at CityU and HKBU, Software Engineer at HKCREO (a Fintech startup) and Alcatel-Lucent S.A. (Nokia Corporation now).

I have a BS in Electroic and Information Engineering from Wuhan University, and a MS in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I also hold a Diploma in International Business English from HKU.

Opinions are just mine.
